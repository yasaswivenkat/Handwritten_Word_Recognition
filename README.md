# Project Name : Handwritten Text Recognition(IAM Dataset)

This project builds and compares deep learning models to classify handwritten words from the IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset.
It uses CNN,CNN-LSTM,CNN-GRU and Transfer Learning(VGG16,ResNet50V2,EfficientNetB0) to find the best-performing model.

Features:
1. Automatic Kaggle dataset download & preprocessing,
2. XML-based image–label extraction,
3. Model training & evaluation(Accuracy,F1,Confusion Matrix),
4. Comparison of multiple architectures and reviewing their accuracies.

Results:
Best Model -> ResNet50V2 Transfer – It achieved the highest accuracy among trained models.

Tech Stack:
1. TensorFlow,
2. Keras,
3. Scikit-learn,
4. OpenCV,
5. KaggleHub,
6. Google Colab.
